  <h1>History of Taj Mahal</h1>
  <p>
    The Taj Mahal, an enduring symbol of love and one of the world's most admired architectural masterpieces,
    stands gracefully and majestically on the banks of the Yamuna river in Agra, India. Built during the height of the Mughal
    Empire, its history intertwines romance, artistry, politics and devotion, making it much more than just
    a monument. It is a testament to human creativity and emotions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The story of the Taj Mahal begins with the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who reigned from 1628 to 1658.
    Shah Jahan was deeply in love with his wife Mumtaz Mahal, whose name translates to "The chosen one of the palace".
    Mumtaz Mahal was not only Shah Jahan's beloved consort but also his trusted advisor and companion, accompanying him on military campaigns.
    In 1631, while giving birth to their fourteenth child, Mumtaz Mahal tragically passed away. Her death left Shah Jahan heartbroken, and in his grief
    he vowed to create a monument so beautiful that it would immortalize their love for eternity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and took approximately 22 years to complete, finishing around 1653.
    It is estimated that over 20,000 artisans, craftsmen, and labourers from across the Mughal Empire and beyond
    participated in its construction. The designs of the Taj Mahal include Persian, Islamic and Indian architecture,
    creating a harmonious blend of styles. The marble itself was sourced from Makrana in Rajasthan, while precious
    stones like jade, crystal, lapis lazuli and turquoise were laid using the pietra dura technique.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1983, the Taj Mahal was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and remains a global icon of love and
    Mughal artistry, attracting millions of visitors every year.

  <h1>The Dark Reality</h1>
  <p>
    Whenever we talk about love we think of the Taj Mahal. But some historians argue it was not purely a symbol of love.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taj Mahal is indeed a beautiful giant marble structure built by Shah Jahan, the 5th Mughal Emperor. 
    Well technically, his great grandfathers looted the Indian Subcontinent and afterwards Shah Jahan said,
    "Yeah, so take some of this money back, but in return build a big, shiny, white building for me."
  </p>
  <p>
    That is how the Taj Mahal was made, with the contribution of Shah Jahan. 
    But is it right to call it a symbol of love?

  <h1>The Black Taj Mahal</h1>
  <p>
    The term "Black Taj Mahal" refers to a mythical black marble mausoleum that was allegedly planned by the Mughal
    Emperor Shah Jahan as a twin structure to the iconic white Taj Mahal in Agra, India. However, there is no 
    concrete evidence of its existence, and modern archaeologists consider the story a myth, possibly inspired by 
    'Mehtab Bagh', a garden located across the Yamuna River from the Taj Mahal, which offers symmetrical views.

  <h1>Outlying Buildings of the Taj Mahal</h1>
  <p>
    Surrounding the iconic white marble mausoleum are several outlying buildings 
    that complete the grandeur of the Taj Mahal complex. These include the red sandstone 
    mosque to the west and a jawāb (a symmetrical building) to the east, both of which 
    balance the overall architectural harmony. The Great Gate (Darwaza-i rauza), 
    an impressive entrance structure, marks the transition from the gardens to the mausoleum. 
    Together, these buildings frame the Taj Mahal and enhance its breathtaking symmetry.
