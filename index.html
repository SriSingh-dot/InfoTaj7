  <font size="5"><p>
   The Taj Mahal, an enduring symbol of love and one of the world's most admired architectural masterpieces,
   stands gracefully and majestically on the banks of the Yamuna river in Agra,India. Built during the height of Mughal
   Empire.Its history interwines romance,artistry,politics and devotion making it much more than just
   a monument. It is a testament to human creativity and emotions.</p>
  <br><br><p>
   The story of the Taj Mahal begins with the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who reigned from 1628 to 1658.
   Shah Jahan was deeply in love with his wife Mumtaz Mahal, whosse name translates to "The chosen one of the palace".
   Mumtaz Mahal was not only Shah Jahan's beloved consort but also his trusted advisor and companion, accompanying him on even military campaigns.
   In 1631, while giving birth to their forteenth child, Mumtaz Mahal tragically passed away. Her death left Shah Jahan heart broken, and in his grief
   he vowed to create a monument so beautiful that would immortalize their love for eterninty.</p>
  <br><br><p>
   Construction of Taj Mahal began in 1632 and took approximately 22 years to complete,finishing around 1653.
   It is estimated that over 20,000 artisans,craftsmen and labourersfrom across the Mughal Empire and beyond
   participated in its construction. The designs of Taj Mahal include Persian,Islamic and Indian architecture,
   creating a hamanous belnd of styles. The marble itself was sourced from Makrana in Rajasthan, while precious
   stones like jade,crystal,lapis lazuli and turquoise were laid using the pietra dura technique</p>
  <br><br><p>
   In 1983,Taj Mahal was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and remains a global icon of love and
   Mughal artistry.,attracting millions of visitors every year.</p>

Whenever we talk about love we think of Taj Mahal.But let me tell you it was anything but a symbol of 
love.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Taj Mahal is indeed a beautiful giant marble structure built by Shah Jahan, the 5th Mughal Emperor. Well 
technically, his great grandfathers looted the Indian Subcontinent and afterwards Shah Jahan said
"Yeah,so take some of this money bavk,but in return build a big,shiny,white building for me"
</p><br>
<p>That is how Taj Mahal was made, with 100% "Contribution" of Mr Shah Jahan.
<br>
But is it rught to call it a symbol of love?</p>
<br>
<p>
<font align="left">the history of Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaj,for whom the monument was built.
<br>
Shah Jahan had seven wives, and several thousands other women who were "won" in wars. Neither was Mumtaj 
his first wife nor was his last wife. Mumtaj was his 4th wife.
Now if he truly and genuinly loved her then why did he kept marrying till the 7th wife.
Simply said Shah Jahan was "interested" in women like almost all other Mughal Emperors were.

<b>Mumtaj was already married  </b> to a general of Shah Jahan, whom Shah Jahan killed beacsue
his wife was too beautiful for him to handle, and married Mumtaj.
</p>


<font align="left">
What??? were you thinking that this so called 'Love Story' ended here?
Unfortunately history has more to tell.
<p>

  <font align="left">
At the age of 39 Mumtaj died <b>during the childbirth of their 14th child</b>.(oh we skipped a lot didn't we,
14 years is a long time). As if this wasn't enough Shah Jahan married Mumtaj's sister
after her death & built the magnificent Taj Mahal as the symbol of 'Love'. And judging by this persons actions
& character I think he was keeping an eye on Mumtaj's sister long before she died.

<i><center><h1> The Black Taj Mahal</h1></center></i>
<font size="2"> source="wikipedia.org"</font>
<font size="5">
<br>
<p>The term "Black Taj Mahl" refers to a mythical black marble mausoleum that was allegedly planned by the Mughal
Emperor Shah Jahan as a twin structure to the iconic white Taj Mahal in Agra, India. Howerver, there is no 
concrete evidence of its existence, and modern archaelogists consider the story a myth, possibly inspired by 
'Mehtab Bagh', a garden located across the Yamuna River from the Taj Mahal, which offers a symmentrical views.
The term black Taj Mahal is often used locally in Burhanpur, Madhya Pradesh, for the tomb of Shahnawaz Khan,
which is built using black stone and is an architectural wonder and tourist site.

<p>
We do not know if the legend is true or false, but it is said that Shah Jahan intended to build a black marble 
mausoleum on the opposite bank of the Yamuna River, directly across from the white Taj Mahal for himself but 
could not because his son, Aurangzeb, overthrew him and imprisoned him in the Agra Fort. Shah Jahan spent the
last years of his life in captivity, gazing at the Taj Mahal from a distance until his death in 1666.
